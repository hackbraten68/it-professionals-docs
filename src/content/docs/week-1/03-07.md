## AWS Availability Zones

### Introduction

Availability Zones (AZs) are a key component of Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance for cloud resources.

### Definition

An Availability Zone is a physically separate data center within an AWS Region, equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

### Key Features

- **Isolation**: Each AZ is isolated from others to prevent failures from spreading.
- **Low-Latency Connectivity**: AZs within a region are connected via high-speed, low-latency networking.
- **Redundancy**: Multiple AZs allow for redundant deployments of resources.

### Benefits

1. **High Availability**: Distribute applications across multiple AZs to ensure continuous operation.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Protect against single points of failure by replicating resources across AZs.
3. **Scalability**: Easily scale resources across different AZs as needed.

### Best Practices

- Deploy critical applications across at least two AZs.
- Use AWS services that automatically leverage multiple AZs.
- Design applications to be AZ-aware for optimal performance and reliability.

### Relation to Regions

- Each AWS Region contains multiple AZs (typically 3 or more).
- AZs in a region work together to provide a robust and resilient infrastructure.

## AWS Pricing Model

Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS:

| Compute | Storage | Data transfer |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| - Calculated either by the hour or the second | - Charged typically per GB | - Outbound is aggregated and charged |
| - Varies by instance type | | - Inbound has no charge (with some exceptions) |
| | | - Charged typically per GB |

AWS has three fundamental drivers of cost: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. These characteristics vary somewhat depending on the AWS offering and pricing model that you choose.In most cases,you won’t becharged for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services in the same AWS Region. Some exceptions exist,so be sure to verify data transfer rates before you begin to use the AWS service.Outbound data transfer is aggregated across servicesand then charged at the outbound data transfer rate. This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out.

### AWS Pricing Philosophy

AWS pricing is based on a consistent philosophy, despite the growing number and types of services offered:

- Pay for what you use at the end of each month
- Start or stop using a product at any time
- No long-term contracts required

#### Utility-Style Pricing Model

AWS offers a range of cloud computing services with a utility-style pricing model:

1. **Pay for what you use**
2. **Pay less when you reserve**
3. **Pay less when you use more**
4. **Pay even less as AWS grows**

These core pricing concepts reflect AWS's commitment to flexible, cost-effective cloud services.

For more detailed information about AWS pricing, refer to the [How AWS Pricing Works](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws_pricing_overview.pdf) guide.

Unless you build data centers for a living, you might have spent too much time and money building them. With AWS, you pay only for the services that you consume with no large upfront expenses. You can lower variable costs. Thus, you no longer need to dedicate valuable resources to building costly infrastructure, including purchasing servers, software licenses, or leasing facilities. Quickly adapt to changing business needs and redirect your focus on innovation and invention. Pay only for what you use and for as long as you need it. All AWS services are available on demand, require no long-term contracts, and have no complex licensing dependencies.

### Pay less when you reserve

![Pay less when you reserve](../../../assets/day-3/pay_less_reserve.png)

For services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), AWS offers reserved capacity options:

#### Reserved Instances Types

1. **All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI)**
2. **Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI)**
3. **No Upfront Payments Reserved Instance (NURI)**

#### Discount Structure

- Larger upfront payments result in greater discounts
- All upfront payment offers the largest discount
- Partial upfront provides lower discounts but requires less initial investment
- No upfront option offers the smallest discount but preserves capital for other projects

#### Benefits of Reserved Capacity

- Minimize risks
- More predictable budget management
- Compliance with policies requiring longer-term commitments

Reserved Instances can lead to significant savings compared to equivalent on-demand capacity, offering flexibility in how you allocate your cloud computing budget.

### Pay less by using more

![Pay less by using more](../../../assets/day-3/pay_less_using_more.png)

#### Tiered Pricing

- As usage increases, you can realize significant savings
- Services like Amazon S3 use tiered pricing
  - Pay less per GB with higher usage

#### Data Transfer Pricing

- Inbound data transfer is free of charge

#### Storage Options

- Multiple storage services available
- Lower costs based on specific needs

#### Benefits of Increased Usage

- Economies of scale
- Increased adoption with controlled costs

#### Flexible Service Options

- AWS offers services to address evolving business needs
- Storage services portfolio example:
  - Options to lower pricing based on:
    1. Frequency of data access
    2. Required retrieval performance

#### Optimizing Savings

- Choose the right combination of storage solutions to:
  - Reduce costs
  - Preserve performance
  - Maintain security
  - Ensure durability

As your AWS usage grows, you can take advantage of volume-based discounts and diverse service options to optimize costs while meeting your specific business requirements.

### Pay less as AWS grows

![Pay less as AWS grows](../../../assets/day-3/pay_less_aws_grows.png)

#### AWS Continuous Improvements

AWS consistently focuses on:

- Reducing data center hardware costs
- Improving operational efficiencies
- Lowering power consumption
- Decreasing overall cost of doing business

#### Economies of Scale

- Optimizations lead to substantial economies of scale
- Savings are passed back to customers through lower pricing

#### Pricing History

- Since 2006, AWS has lowered pricing more than 75 times
- Continues to reduce prices

#### Technology Upgrades

- Future, higher-performing resources replace current ones
- No extra charge for these upgrades

AWS's commitment to efficiency and scale benefits customers through consistent price reductions and improved technology at no additional cost.

### Custom pricing

AWS realizes that every customer has different needs. If none of the AWS pricing models work for your project, custom pricing is available for high-volume projects with unique requirements.

### AWS Free Tier

AWS also offers a variety of services and features for no additional charge. This slide includes some of them:

- **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** – You can provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** – You can use this service to control your users’ access to AWS services and resources.
- **Consolidated Billing** – You can use this billing feature in the AWS Organizations service to consolidate payment for multiple AWS accounts. Consolidated Billing provides the following:
  - One bill for multiple accounts
  - The ability to track each account’s charges
  - The opportunity to decrease charges because of volume pricing discounts from combined usage
  - The ability to consolidate all of your accounts by using Consolidated Billing and get tiered benefits
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** – With this service, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud.
- **AWS CloudFormation** – Developers and systems administrators can use this service to create a collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion.
- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** – This service automatically adds or removes resources according to conditions that you define. The resources that you are using increase seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs.
- **AWS OpsWorks** – You can use this application management service to deploy and operate applications of all shapes and sizes.

Though these services do not incur any charge, other charges might be associated with other AWS services that are used with these services. For example, when you automatically scale additional EC2 instances, you will be charged for those instances.
