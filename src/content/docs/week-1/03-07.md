## AWS Availability Zones

### Introduction

Availability Zones (AZs) are a key component of Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance for cloud resources.

### Definition

An Availability Zone is a physically separate data center within an AWS Region, equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

### Key Features

- **Isolation**: Each AZ is isolated from others to prevent failures from spreading.
- **Low-Latency Connectivity**: AZs within a region are connected via high-speed, low-latency networking.
- **Redundancy**: Multiple AZs allow for redundant deployments of resources.

### Benefits

1. **High Availability**: Distribute applications across multiple AZs to ensure continuous operation.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Protect against single points of failure by replicating resources across AZs.
3. **Scalability**: Easily scale resources across different AZs as needed.

### Best Practices

- Deploy critical applications across at least two AZs.
- Use AWS services that automatically leverage multiple AZs.
- Design applications to be AZ-aware for optimal performance and reliability.

### Relation to Regions

- Each AWS Region contains multiple AZs (typically 3 or more).
- AZs in a region work together to provide a robust and resilient infrastructure.

## Soft Skill Course

### Hopes & Fears

Hopes: Learn something new, overcome imposter syndrome.

Fears: Being awkward and not enough for this position.

1. I guess something between 0-2, depends on the situation.
2. It is a feeling straight out of the guts.
3. I would say 1 out of 4 inner dialouges are somehow mature, the rest is definitely screaming/judging at me.
4. I do have a helper syndrome, which sucks with situations saying no. also i have a patience of an angel
