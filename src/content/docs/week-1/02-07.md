## What is Cloud Computing ?

### Definition

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, processing power, databases, networking, analytics, and software.

### Deployment Models

### 1. On-Premises

- Infrastructure managed in-house
- Full control but higher costs and maintenance

### 2. Cloud

- All services hosted by third-party provider
- Scalable and cost-effective, but less control

### 3. Hybrid Cloud

- Combination of on-premises and cloud
- Balances control and flexibility

### Comparison

| Aspect | On-Premises | Cloud | Hybrid Cloud |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Control | High | Low | Medium |
| Scalability | Limited | High | High |
| Initial Cost | High | Low | Medium |
| Maintenance | In-house | Provider | Shared |
| Security | Full control | Shared | Customizable |

### Cloud Computing Overview

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

- With cloud computing, you can think of (and use) your infrastructure as software.

- The three cloud service models are:
  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
  - PaaS (Platform as a Service)
  - SaaS (Software as a Service)

- The three cloud deployment models are:
  - Cloud
  - Hybrid
  - Private (or on-premises) cloud

- Almost anything that you can implement with traditional IT can also be implemented as an AWS cloud computing service.
