## What is Cloud Computing ?

### Definition

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, processing power, databases, networking, analytics, and software.

### Deployment Models

### 1. On-Premises

- Infrastructure managed in-house
- Full control but higher costs and maintenance

### 2. Cloud

- All services hosted by third-party provider
- Scalable and cost-effective, but less control

### 3. Hybrid Cloud

- Combination of on-premises and cloud
- Balances control and flexibility

### Comparison

| Aspect | On-Premises | Cloud | Hybrid Cloud |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Control | High | Low | Medium |
| Scalability | Limited | High | High |
| Initial Cost | High | Low | Medium |
| Maintenance | In-house | Provider | Shared |
| Security | Full control | Shared | Customizable |

### Key Takeaways

![Key Takeaways](../../../assets/day-2/takeaways.png)

### Cloud Computing Overview

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

- With cloud computing, you can think of (and use) your infrastructure as software.

- The three cloud service models are:
  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
  - PaaS (Platform as a Service)
  - SaaS (Software as a Service)

- The three cloud deployment models are:
  - Cloud
  - Hybrid
  - Private (or on-premises) cloud

- Almost anything that you can implement with traditional IT can also be implemented as an AWS cloud computing service.

### Massive Economies of Scale

#### Introduction

Amazon Web Services (AWS) leverages massive economies of scale to provide cloud computing services at a level that individual companies typically cannot match on their own.

#### What are Economies of Scale?

Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that businesses obtain due to their scale of operation. The larger the scale, the more cost-effective the operation becomes.

#### How AWS Achieves Massive Economies of Scale

1. **Global Infrastructure**: AWS operates data centers worldwide, allowing for bulk purchasing and efficient resource allocation.

2. **High Utilization**: AWS serves millions of customers, ensuring high utilization of resources.

3. **Continuous Innovation**: Constant improvements in hardware and software efficiency.

4. **Diverse Customer Base**: Aggregating demand across various industries and use cases.

#### Benefits for AWS Customers

1. **Lower Costs**:
   - Reduced prices for cloud services
   - Pay-as-you-go model eliminates upfront capital expenses

2. **Access to Cutting-Edge Technology**:
   - Latest hardware and software without direct investment

3. **Scalability**:
   - Ability to rapidly scale up or down without additional infrastructure costs

4. **Global Reach**:
   - Easy deployment across multiple geographic regions

5. **Reliability and Redundancy**:
   - High-availability infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of building it independently

6. **Focus on Core Business**:
   - Reduced need for in-house IT infrastructure management

7. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Regular updates and new services without additional cost

8. **Environmental Benefits**:
   - More energy-efficient than multiple smaller data centers
