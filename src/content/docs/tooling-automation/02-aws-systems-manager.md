## AWS Systems Manager ‚Äì Automation Capability

The **Automation** capability in **AWS Systems Manager** allows you to define common IT tasks  
as a collection of **steps in an SSM document**.

These steps can then be run across an entire collection of AWS resources.

---

### Use Cases

Examples of tasks you can automate:

- Remediating **unreachable instances**
- Creating **golden AMIs**
- Patching **instances**

Custom automations can also be authored in **JSON**.

> üîÅ You can use **Amazon EventBridge** to automatically trigger Systems Manager automations.

---

### Suggested Development & Testing Approach

1. **Create an automation document**  
   Or use an existing **template** with steps and parameters that Systems Manager can run sequentially.

2. **Run the automation document**  
   Depending on the requested actions, Systems Manager can automatically:

   - Launch an instance  
   - Take a snapshot  
   - Tag an instance  
   - Delete old images  
   - Terminate an EC2 instance

3. **Monitor the automation workflow**  
   - Use the **AWS Management Console** or other tools.
   - After completion, **validate the results**.

   Example:  
   Launch a **test instance** from an AMI that was updated by the automation to confirm expected characteristics.

Run Command is ideal for **secure, remote administration** of EC2 instances without the need for direct access.

![Session Manager](../../../assets/tooling_automation/aws_systems_manager/session_manager.png)

With the Session Manager capability in Systems Manager, you can manage your EC2 instances through an interactive browser-based shell in the AWS Management Console. You can use also use the AWS CLI or SSH to start a session.

Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports in the security groups, maintain bastion host instances in Amazon EC2 subnets, or manage SSH keys.

Session Manager also helps you comply with corporate policies that require controlled access to instances, strict security practices, and auditable logs that contain instance access details.

When you can connect to a Linux or Windows EC2 instance, Session Manager tracks each user who started a session on each instance. You can audit which user accessed an instance and when they accessed the instance using AWS CloudTrail. You can also configure Session Manager to log every command performed on an instance to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

![Patch Manager](../../../assets/tooling_automation/aws_systems_manager/patch_manager.png)

## AWS Systems Manager ‚Äì Patch Manager

Patching servers and instances manually can lead to various challenges:

#### Common Challenges

- ‚è≥ Time-consuming process across **multiple EC2 instances** or **on-premises machines**
- üîÅ **Repetitive** and error-prone tasks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of **downtime** due to errors
- üìã **Compliance** and audit requirements

---

### Automating Patching with Patch Manager

You can use **Patch Manager** to automate the patching process by following these steps:

1. **Create a patch baseline**  
   - Define rules that automatically **approve or reject** released patches.

2. **Define a maintenance window**  
   - Schedule when patches should be applied.
   - Group instances together for targeted patching.

3. **Apply patches during the maintenance window**  
   - Patches are deployed and each instance in the patch group is **rebooted** if required.

4. **Review results and compliance reports**  
   - Check the **patch status** and ensure that instances are compliant with the defined baseline.

---

‚úÖ Patch Manager helps you **standardize**, **automate**, and **secure** your patching workflows across AWS and hybrid environments.

![Maintenance Windows](../../../assets/tooling_automation/aws_systems_manager/maintenance_windows.png)

### Example Workflow

1. **Create a parameter**

   - Name: `/Dev/DB/Password`  
   - Purpose: Store a **database password** for the **Dev** environment  
   - Data type: **SecureString** (sensitive, encrypted)

2. **Encryption**

   - Parameter Store uses **AWS KMS** to **encrypt** the value (e.g., `DE24xd0w`)

3. **Retrieve the parameter using AWS CLI**

   ```bash
   aws ssm get-parameter \
     --name "/Dev/DB/Password" \
     --with-decryption
   ```

   - The `--with-decryption` flag returns the **decrypted value** of the secure parameter.
