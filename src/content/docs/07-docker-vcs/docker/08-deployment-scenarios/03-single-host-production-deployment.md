# Single-Host Production Deployment

## Description

Single-host production deployment refers to running Docker containers on a single physical or virtual server. This server can be located **on-premises** (in your own data center or office) or in the **cloud** (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplet, or Azure VM).

This approach is well-suited for **small to medium applications** with relatively **low complexity**. It is often chosen by startups, hobby projects, or teams that want to quickly bring an application into production without the overhead of orchestrators like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

While it provides a straightforward path to deployment, it is important to understand the trade-offs, particularly regarding **scalability** and **resilience**.

## Tools and Setup

### 1. Basic Container Management

* **`docker run`**
  The simplest way to launch a container. For example:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 80:80 myapp:latest
  ```

  Runs a container in detached mode and maps port 80 of the host to port 80 inside the container.

* **`docker-compose`**
  Useful for multi-container applications. A `docker-compose.yml` file can define multiple services, networks, and volumes.
  Example:

  ```yaml
  version: '3.8'
  services:
    web:
      image: myapp:latest
      ports:
        - "80:80"
      restart: always
    db:
      image: postgres:15
      volumes:
        - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  volumes:
    db_data:
  ```

### 2. Service Management with Systemd

* Containers can be managed as **system services** using **systemd** to ensure they start automatically on reboot and are monitored for crashes.

* Example `myapp.service` unit file:

  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=MyApp Container
  After=network.target

  [Service]
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --rm -p 80:80 --name myapp myapp:latest
  ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop myapp
  Restart=always

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

* Benefits:

  * Automatic restarts
  * Integration with system logs (`journalctl`)
  * Easier process supervision

## Advantages

* **Ease of Setup**
  Straightforward deployment without the complexity of orchestrators.

* **Minimal Learning Curve**
  Developers already familiar with Docker commands can quickly move to production.

* **Low Maintenance Overhead**
  Less infrastructure to manage; ideal for teams without dedicated DevOps engineers.

* **Cost-Effective**
  Running on a single VM or physical machine reduces infrastructure costs.

* **Good Fit for Small Projects**
  Perfect for personal projects, MVPs, or low-traffic production services.

---

## Limitations

* **Not Scalable**
  Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) requires manual setup and reconfiguration.

* **Single Point of Failure**
  If the server fails, the entire application goes offline.

* **Limited High Availability**
  No built-in failover or redundancy.

* **Resource Constraints**
  Limited by the physical or virtual hardware capacity of the host (CPU, RAM, disk).

* **Manual Updates and Rollbacks**
  Requires careful handling during deployments to avoid downtime.

---

## Best Practices

* **Monitoring & Logging**
  Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK/EFK stacks to observe application and container performance.

* **Backups**
  Regularly back up volumes and configuration files.

* **Security Hardening**

  * Keep Docker and the host OS updated.
  * Run containers with non-root users.
  * Use firewalls and reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx, Traefik).

* **CI/CD Integration**
  Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins for reliable updates.

---

## Use Cases

* **Prototyping and MVPs**
  Quickly deploy an application for user testing.

* **Small Business or Hobby Projects**
  Lightweight production setups without large budgets.

* **Internal Tools**
  Dashboards, small APIs, or development utilities that do not require high availability.

## Conclusion

Single-host production deployment is a **simple, cost-effective, and practical** solution for many small-scale projects. It strikes a balance between development convenience and production readiness, but it comes with limitations regarding **scalability** and **fault tolerance**.

For larger or mission-critical systems, consider moving to **multi-host orchestrated deployments** (Kubernetes, Swarm, or Nomad). However, for smaller projects, a single host is often more than enough.
