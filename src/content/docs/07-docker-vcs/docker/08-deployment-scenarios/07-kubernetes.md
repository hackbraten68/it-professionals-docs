### Description

Kubernetes is a powerful open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Benefits

- Self-healing (restarts failed containers)
- Declarative configuration (YAML)
- Broad community and tooling support

### Tools

- `kubectl`
- Helm Charts
- Managed services (e.g. GKE, EKS, AKS)

### Considerations

- Higher complexity
- Steep learning curve
