Docker containers are designed to be **ephemeral**. By default, any data stored inside a container is lost once the container is removed or recreated. This is a problem for many applications that require persistent storage, such as databases or content management systems.

In this lesson, you will learn:

- Why persistence is important in Docker

- The difference between **volumes** and **bind mounts**

- How to create and use persistent storage

- Best practices for managing data in containers
