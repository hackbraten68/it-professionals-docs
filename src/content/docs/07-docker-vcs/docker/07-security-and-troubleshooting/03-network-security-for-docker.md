title: Network Security for Docker
---
### Avoid Exposing Ports Unnecessarily

Use docker network to isolate services internally.

### Use Firewalls or Reverse Proxies

Control access to containers via Nginx, Traefik, or UFW.

### Encrypt Data in Transit

Use TLS for APIs and service connections.

### Prevent DNS Rebinding and Spoofing

Validate inputs and restrict access to the Docker API socket.
