title: What is Docker Compose ?
---


**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications. Instead of manually running `docker run` commands for each container, Compose lets you define your entire setup in a single `docker-compose.yml` file.

**Key benefits:**

- Define all services, networks, and volumes in one file
- Easily start or stop your complete setup with a single command (`docker-compose up/down`)
- Simplifies local development and testing
