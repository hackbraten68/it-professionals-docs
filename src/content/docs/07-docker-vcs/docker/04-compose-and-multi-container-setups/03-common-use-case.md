title: Common Use Case - Web App with a Database
---

A typical multi-container setup might include:

- A **frontend** (e.g. React, served by Nginx)

- A **backend API** (e.g. Express, Flask)

- A **database** (e.g. PostgreSQL or MongoDB)

Using Docker Compose, all three can be started with a single command. This is great for local development or small deployments.
