title: Running and Managing Compose

**Commands:**

- `docker-compose up` – starts the defined services

- `docker-compose down` – stops and removes containers

- `docker-compose build` – builds the images (if using `build:` context)

- `docker-compose logs` – view logs from all services

- `docker-compose ps` – shows running containers

You can also use `-d` for detached mode:  
`docker-compose up -d`
