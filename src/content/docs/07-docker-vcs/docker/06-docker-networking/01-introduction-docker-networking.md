title: Introduction to Docker Networking
---

Docker provides an isolated environment for containers, but networking is essential for containers to communicate with each other or the outside world. Docker includes its own internal DNS system, virtual switches, and different networking drivers to support various use casesâ€”from simple web stacks to distributed systems.

Understanding Docker networking helps you:

- Connect containers to each other.
- Control traffic flow.
- Isolate workloads.
- Expose services to users or clients outside the Docker host.
