## Key Takeaways

1. **Containers**
   - Containers are lightweight, portable runtime units for applications.
   - They are **ephemeral by design**, meaning they can be created, stopped, and removed quickly without affecting the underlying system.
   - Containers can be **inspected** for logs, environment variables, or running processes, making troubleshooting easier.
   - Common commands:  
     - `docker ps` (list running containers)  
     - `docker logs <container>` (view logs)  
     - `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash` (access container shell)  

2. **Images**
   - Images are **immutable and versioned artifacts** that serve as blueprints for containers.
   - They can be **pulled** from registries, **built** locally with Dockerfiles, **tagged**, and **pushed** to share.
   - They consist of **layers**, enabling efficient reuse and caching.
   - Common commands:  
     - `docker build -t my-app:1.0 .`  
     - `docker pull nginx:latest`  
     - `docker push myrepo/my-app:1.0`  

3. **Networks & Volumes**
   - **Networks** connect containers with each other and external systems.  
     - Default types: `bridge`, `host`, `none`.  
     - Custom networks provide better isolation and DNS-based service discovery.  
   - **Volumes** persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container.  
     - Named volumes are managed by Docker, while bind mounts link host directories.  
   - Common commands:  
     - `docker network create my-net`  
     - `docker run -d --network my-net my-service`  
     - `docker volume create data-vol`  

4. **Advanced Flags**
   - **Resource limits** allow restricting CPU, memory, or file descriptors.  
     - Example: `docker run -m 512m --cpus="1.5" my-app`  
   - **Logging drivers** provide flexibility in capturing logs (`json-file`, `syslog`, `fluentd`, etc.).  
   - **Filtering and formatting** improve command output readability.  
     - Example: `docker ps --filter "status=exited" --format "{{.Names}}"`  
   - **Contexts** simplify working with multiple Docker environments (local, remote, cloud).  
     - Example: `docker context use remote-prod`  

5. **Best Practices**
   - Keep images **small and secure** by using minimal base images like `alpine` or `slim`.
   - Use **multi-stage builds** to separate build dependencies from the runtime environment.
   - Optimize **layer caching** by ordering Dockerfile instructions from least to most volatile.
   - Schedule **regular cleanup** (`docker system prune`) to free up unused resources.
   - Use **volumes** for persistent data and avoid writing directly to the container’s filesystem.
