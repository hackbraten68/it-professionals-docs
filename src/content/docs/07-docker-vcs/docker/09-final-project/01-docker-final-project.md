# Final Wrap-Up and Weekend Project: Docker Course

As we reach the end of this Docker course, it is time to consolidate your learning with a **practical, hands-on project**. This final weekend assignment gives you the chance to demonstrate what you’ve learned by containerizing a small application or tool, documenting your process, and sharing the result with your peers.

The goal is **not** to create something overly complex, but rather to show your ability to design, configure, and run containers in a structured and reproducible way.

---

## 🎯 Your Task

* Select or build a **simple application** or service of your choice.
* **Dockerize** it using a `Dockerfile` and/or a `docker-compose.yml`.
* Verify that your container runs smoothly in a **clean environment**.
* Add **useful configuration options** (e.g., environment variables, volumes).
* Write a **clear and concise README** documenting how to build, run, and test your project.

This project is your opportunity to demonstrate **practical Docker skills**—containerization, reproducibility, and clear documentation.

## 🧠 Suggested Project Ideas

Here are some ideas to spark inspiration. You may choose one or come up with your own project:

### Idea 1: Static Website

* Build a small website using **HTML and CSS**.
* Serve it with an **Nginx container**.
* Optionally, prepare a second container for a backend/API (to be expanded later).

### Idea 2: Simple API

* Use **Python Flask** or **Node.js Express** to create a minimal **REST API**.
* Write a custom `Dockerfile` to package your app.
* Bonus: Add **Swagger UI** or a **Postman collection** for easy testing.

### Idea 3: Personal Dashboard (Prebuilt Tools)

* Deploy a prebuilt tool such as **Portainer**, **Uptime Kuma**, or **Whoogle**.
* Define the setup in a `docker-compose.yml`.
* Include setup/configuration notes in your README.

### Idea 4: Development Toolchain

* Containerize a toolchain such as **Jupyter Notebook**, **code-server**, or another developer utility.
* Emphasize **usability** and **ease of setup**.
* Clearly document environment variables and mounting points.

## 🗂️ Recommended Project Folder Structure

Organize your project in a clear and standard way:

```plaintext
/docker-weekend-project/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile (if needed)
├── /src/ or /app/    # application code
├── README.md         # documentation
└── .env (optional)   # environment variables
```

A well-structured project makes it easier for others (and your future self) to understand and reuse your work.

---

## 📝 README Requirements

Your `README.md` should contain at least:

* **📌 Project Title & Short Description**
  A clear name and one-sentence summary.

* **🚀 How to Start the Project**
  Step-by-step instructions with commands (`docker build`, `docker-compose up`, etc.).

* **🧩 Explanation of Containers**
  What each container does and why it is included.

* **🔧 Environment Variables & Ports**
  List required variables (with sample values) and explain exposed ports.

* **💾 Volumes or Persistent Data**
  If applicable, explain which data is stored and where.

* **🧪 Optional Testing Instructions**
  Example curl commands, sample data, or steps to verify functionality.

Clear documentation is just as important as working code.

---

## 🧭 Tips & Hints

* Test on a **clean environment** (e.g., run `docker system prune` or use a fresh VM) to ensure reproducibility.
* Prefer **official base images** (`python:3.11`, `nginx:alpine`, etc.).
* Focus on **simplicity and clarity**—a small, well-documented project is better than an overcomplicated one.
* Add **comments** in your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to explain tricky parts.

---

## 🙋 Need Help?

If you run into issues:

* Revisit the **official Docker documentation**.
* Look back at **course examples and exercises**.
* Ask questions in the **course chat** (please do so before Sunday afternoon for timely feedback).

## 🚢 Final Words

This project is your chance to **demonstrate Docker mastery**—from containerization to documentation.
Keep it simple, make it reproducible, and most importantly: **have fun building!**

Good luck, and happy dockerizing!
