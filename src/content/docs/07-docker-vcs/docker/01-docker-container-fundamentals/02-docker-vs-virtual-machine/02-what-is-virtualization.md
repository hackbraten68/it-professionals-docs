title: What is Virtualization?
---

**Virtualization** allows you to run one or more simulated “machines” on a single physical host.

- **Host OS**: The real operating system installed on hardware.
- **Hypervisor (VMM)**: Software layer that allocates CPU, memory, I/O to guest systems
- **Guest OS**: Full operating system running inside each VM
