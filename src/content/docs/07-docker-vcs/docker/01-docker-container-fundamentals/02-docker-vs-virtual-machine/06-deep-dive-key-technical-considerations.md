title: Deep Dive Key Technical Considerations
---
### Performance

- **VMs** emulate virtual hardware; small I/O & CPU penalty.
- **Containers** run natively on host kernel; near-bare-metal speeds.

### Security

- **VMs**: Attack surface limited per guest OS; hypervisor vulnerabilities are rare.
- **Containers**: Kernel exploits can affect all containers; use SELinux/AppArmor, root-less Docker.

### Networking

- **VMs**: Virtual NICs bridged/NATâ€™d by hypervisor.
- **Containers**: Docker networks (bridge, overlay); built-in DNS; flexible micro-segmentation.

### Storage

- **VMs**: Virtual disks (qcow2, VDI); full snapshots.
- **Containers**: Copy-on-write layers; volumes for persistent data.
