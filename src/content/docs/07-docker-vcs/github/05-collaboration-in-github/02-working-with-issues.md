Issues are GitHubâ€™s way of tracking tasks and discussions.

### How to use

- Create an issue when you find a bug or have a new idea
- Assign team members to issues
- Use labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `help wanted`) to categorize
- Link issues to commits or PRs

```bash
# Example: Creating a new issue
1. Go to the "Issues" tab of your repo
2. Click "New issue"
3. Describe the problem or feature
4. Assign, label, and submit
```
