title: Branching Strategy
---

Working on separate branches helps isolate development and avoid conflicts.

### Typical Workflow

- `main` or `master`: stable production code
- `feature/my-feature`: for developing new features
- `bugfix/some-bug`: for fixing bugs

```bash
# Example: Creating a new branch
git checkout -b feature/user-auth
```
