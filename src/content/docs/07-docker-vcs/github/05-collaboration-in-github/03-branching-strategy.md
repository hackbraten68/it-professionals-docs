title: Branching Strategy
---

Branching is one of the most powerful features of Git. It allows teams and individuals to work on separate lines of development without interfering with each other. By using a clear branching strategy, developers can ensure smoother collaboration, isolate changes, and reduce the risk of conflicts when merging code.

---

## Why Use Branches?

- **Isolation:** Each branch represents an independent line of work. Changes in one branch do not affect the others until merged.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different tasks simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.
- **Safety:** The `main` (or `master`) branch remains stable and production-ready, while experimental work happens elsewhere.
- **Flexibility:** You can test, roll back, or discard work easily without impacting the main project.

## Typical Branching Workflow

A common approach is to organize branches by purpose. Here are some standard branch types:

### 1. `main` (or `master`)

- Represents **stable production code**.
- Always kept deployable.
- Only thoroughly reviewed and tested code is merged here.

### 2. Feature Branches

- Naming convention: `feature/my-feature`
- Purpose: Develop **new features** without affecting the main branch.
- Lifecycle:
  - Created from `main`
  - Used for development and testing
  - Merged into `main` after review and testing

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/user-auth
```

### 3. Bugfix Branches

* Naming convention: `bugfix/some-bug`
* Purpose: Address and fix **specific bugs**.
* Lifecycle:

  * Created from `main` (or a release branch if available)
  * Merged back once the fix is confirmed

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/login-error
```

### 4. Release Branches (Optional, in larger workflows)

* Naming convention: `release/1.0.0`
* Purpose: Prepare a **release version** of the project.
* Allows final bug fixes and polishing before merging into `main`.

### 5. Hotfix Branches (Optional, for urgent fixes)

* Naming convention: `hotfix/critical-issue`
* Purpose: Quickly fix urgent issues in production without waiting for the normal feature/bugfix workflow.

## Common Branching Models

Different teams adopt different strategies depending on project size and workflow needs:

### GitHub Flow

* Simple model, often used in smaller teams or continuous deployment setups.
* Only two branch types:

  * `main` → production
  * Short-lived feature branches → merged into `main` via pull requests

### Git Flow

* More structured, designed for larger projects.
* Branch types include: `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`.
* Advantages: Clear separation of work stages.
* Disadvantages: Can feel complex for small teams.

### Trunk-Based Development

* Developers commit directly to `main` or use very short-lived branches.
* Requires strong automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.
* Promotes rapid delivery but can be risky without proper safeguards.

## Best Practices for Branching

* **Use descriptive names:**
  Example: `feature/payment-integration` instead of `feature/test1`.
* **Keep branches small and focused:**
  Avoid mixing unrelated changes.
* **Sync regularly with `main`:**
  Rebase or merge frequently to minimize conflicts.
* **Use Pull Requests (PRs):**
  PRs allow discussion, code review, and automated testing before merging.
* **Delete merged branches:**
  Keeps the repository clean and avoids clutter.

## Example Workflow

1. **Create a branch for new work:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/user-auth
   ```

2. **Work on the feature and commit changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add user authentication module"
   ```

3. **Push the branch to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/user-auth
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request:**

   * Request code reviews.
   * Discuss improvements.
   * Ensure tests pass.

5. **Merge into `main`:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/user-auth
   ```

6. **Delete the branch once merged:**

   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/user-auth
   ```

## Summary

A well-defined branching strategy:

* Ensures stability in the `main` branch.
* Provides clarity for developers.
* Supports efficient collaboration.
* Reduces the risk of conflicts and deployment issues.

Whether you choose **GitHub Flow**, **Git Flow**, or another model, the key is **consistency across the team**. Agree on conventions, follow them strictly, and your development process will be smoother and more productive.
