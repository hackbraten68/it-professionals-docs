title: Introduction to GitHub Collaboration
---

GitHub is not just a place to store code—it's a platform for collaboration. Whether you're working on a solo project or contributing to a massive open-source repository, GitHub helps teams work together efficiently.

### Key Concepts

- **Repositories (Repos):** Store your code and collaboration history.
- **Issues:** Used to track tasks, bugs, or feature requests.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Let others know you’ve made changes and want them to be reviewed and merged.
- **Branches:** Allow parallel development without breaking the main codebase.
