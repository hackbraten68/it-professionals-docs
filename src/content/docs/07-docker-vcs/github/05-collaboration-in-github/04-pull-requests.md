title: Pull Requests (PRs)
---

Pull Requests are how code changes get merged into the main project.

### Good PR Practices

- Describe your changes clearly
- Link related issues (`Closes #12`)
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Request reviews from teammates

```bash
# Example: Create a PR
1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Add title, description, and reviewers
4. Submit the PR
```
