title: What are GitHub Actions ?
---
GitHub Actions let you:

- **Automate workflows** like building, testing, and deploying code.
- **Run custom scripts** in response to GitHub events (like pushing code, creating a pull request, or opening an issue).
- **Build CI/CD pipelines** easily using YAML files stored in your repository.

A typical workflow file lives in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
