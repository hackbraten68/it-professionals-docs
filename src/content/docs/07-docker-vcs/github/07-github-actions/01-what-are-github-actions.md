title: What are GitHub Actions?
---

GitHub Actions is a **powerful automation feature** built directly into GitHub. It allows developers and teams to automate tasks within the software development lifecycle, such as building, testing, and deploying applications.

---

## Key Capabilities

- **Automate Workflows**  
  Run automated tasks in response to events in your repository (e.g., a push, pull request, or issue creation).  
  Examples: run tests when code is pushed, deploy to production after merging to `main`.

- **Custom Scripts**  
  Write your own scripts or reuse actions created by the community. Actions can be combined into workflows to create flexible pipelines.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Set up **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** processes with just a YAML file. This ensures code is automatically tested and deployed consistently.

---

## How It Works

1. **Events** trigger workflows  
   - Examples: `push`, `pull_request`, `issues`, `schedule` (cron jobs).

2. **Workflows** define the automation  
   - A workflow is a YAML configuration stored in your repo.  
   - Location: `.github/workflows/`

3. **Jobs** run inside a workflow  
   - Each job consists of one or more steps.  
   - Jobs can run in sequence or in parallel.

4. **Steps** perform actions  
   - A step can run a script, a shell command, or use a pre-built action from the GitHub Marketplace.

## Workflow File Structure

A workflow is defined in a `.yml` file inside `.github/workflows/`.  
Hereâ€™s a minimal example:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Check out repository code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Set up Node.js
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      # Install dependencies and run tests
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
````

---

## Common Use Cases

* **Continuous Integration**: Automatically test code for every pull request.
* **Continuous Deployment**: Deploy to environments (staging, production) after merging.
* **Code Quality Checks**: Run linters or security scans automatically.
* **Scheduled Tasks**: Run jobs on a timer (daily/weekly cleanups, reports).
* **Issue & PR Automation**: Add labels, assign reviewers, or greet first-time contributors.

---

## GitHub Marketplace

* Thousands of pre-built actions are available for free.
* Categories include deployments, testing frameworks, cloud integrations, code analysis, and more.
* Example: `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `docker/login-action`.

---

## Benefits

* **Native Integration**: Works directly with GitHub repositories.
* **Scalability**: Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows runners.
* **Community Driven**: Large ecosystem of reusable actions.
* **Flexibility**: From simple scripts to complex multi-job pipelines.

## Summary

GitHub Actions provides a seamless way to **automate software development workflows** without leaving GitHub.
By using simple YAML definitions, you can create powerful pipelines for **building, testing, and deploying code**, while also automating routine project tasks.
It is an essential tool for modern DevOps practices and continuous delivery.
