title: Introduction to Branching
---

Branching in Git allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work without changing the main codebase.

- **Main idea**: Each branch represents an independent line of development.
- **Why use branches?**
  - Isolate features
  - Test new ideas
  - Collaborate without conflict
- **Default branch**: `main` or `master`
