title: Pull Requests
---

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a feature provided by platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket that allows developers to propose changes to a repository.  
It is one of the central tools for **collaboration**, **code review**, and **maintaining code quality** in modern software development workflows.

---

## Why Pull Requests Are Important

- **Collaboration:** Share your work with teammates in a controlled and visible way.  
- **Code Review:** Request feedback from others before merging into the main branch.  
- **Quality Control:** Ensure code meets project standards through automated checks and peer review.  
- **Documentation:** PRs act as a historical record of what was changed and why.  
- **Safe Integration:** Merges are tracked and conflicts are handled systematically.

## Typical PR Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**  
   Start by creating a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-login
    ```

This keeps changes isolated from the `main` branch.

2. **Make and Commit Changes**
   Work on your code, then stage and commit it:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new login functionality"
   ```

3. **Push Changes to Remote Repository**
   Send your branch to GitHub (or another platform):

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-login
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request**

   * Go to the repository on GitHub.
   * Click **“New Pull Request”**.
   * Select your branch as the source and the target branch (usually `main`).
   * Provide a **clear title** and **detailed description** of your changes.

5. **Add Reviewers and Labels**

   * Assign team members as reviewers.
   * Add labels (e.g., `bugfix`, `feature`, `documentation`) for better tracking.

6. **Discussion and Review**

   * Reviewers can comment, request changes, or approve the PR.
   * Authors respond to feedback, update the branch, and push further commits.
   * Conversations remain documented for transparency.

7. **Testing and CI/CD Checks**

   * Automated tests and checks often run on each PR.
   * Ensures new code doesn’t break existing functionality.

8. **Merge the PR**
   Once approved:

   * **Merge** into the main branch using options like:

     * **Merge Commit:** Keeps full history.
     * **Squash and Merge:** Combines all commits into one.
     * **Rebase and Merge:** Rewrites commit history for a cleaner timeline.

9. **Delete the Branch**
   After merging, the feature branch is no longer needed.

   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/new-login       # local
   git push origin --delete feature/new-login  # remote
   ```

## Best Practices for Pull Requests

* Keep PRs **small and focused** on a single feature or fix.
* Write **clear commit messages** and a **descriptive PR title**.
* Provide context in the PR description (what, why, how).
* Run tests locally before submitting.
* Review others’ PRs carefully and constructively.
* Use draft PRs to share work in progress without requesting review yet.

## Conclusion

Pull Requests are not just about merging code — they are a **communication tool**.
They encourage collaboration, maintain quality, and document the development process.
By following best practices and a structured workflow, teams can ensure smooth integration of new features while reducing bugs and misunderstandings.
