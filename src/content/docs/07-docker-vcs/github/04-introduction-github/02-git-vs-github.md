title: Git vs. GitHub
---

Understanding the difference between **Git** and **GitHub** is fundamental when learning version control and collaborative software development. Although they are closely related, they serve different purposes.

---

## 1. What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)**. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to help developers manage changes in source code efficiently.  

Key characteristics of Git:

- **Local-first**: All operations (commits, branching, merging) happen locally, without requiring an internet connection.  
- **Snapshots, not differences**: Git records snapshots of your project files instead of only changes, which ensures speed and reliability.  
- **Branching and merging**: Developers can experiment with new features in branches and later merge them back into the main project.  
- **Command-line based**: Primarily operated using commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull`.  

**Use case**: A developer working on a new feature can track changes, revert mistakes, and maintain a complete project history—all without leaving their computer.

## 2. What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories**. While Git runs on your computer, GitHub provides an **online space** where developers can store, share, and collaborate on projects.

Key characteristics of GitHub:

- **Collaboration tools**: Issue tracking, pull requests, discussions, and project boards.  
- **Remote repositories**: Code can be pushed from a local Git repo to GitHub, enabling team collaboration.  
- **Graphical user interface (GUI)**: Offers a web-based interface for browsing code, reviewing history, and managing projects.  
- **Integrations**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD, GitHub Pages for hosting, and integration with other developer tools.  

**Use case**: A team of developers spread across the world can contribute to the same project, submit pull requests for code review, and track issues—all in one place.

## 3. Key Differences: Git vs. GitHub

| Feature | Git | GitHub |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Type** | Local version control system | Cloud-based hosting platform |
| **Operation** | Works offline | Requires internet for remote sync (push/pull) |
| **Interface** | Command-line tool | Web interface, desktop app, and APIs |
| **Collaboration** | Individual use, unless repos are shared manually | Built-in collaboration features (issues, pull requests, reviews) |
| **Scope** | Tracks and manages code history locally | Hosts repositories and enables teamwork globally |
| **Cost** | Free, open-source | Free for public repos, paid plans for private/enterprise features |

## 4. How Git and GitHub Work Together

1. **Initialize Git locally**: A developer creates a Git repository on their computer (`git init`).  
2. **Track changes**: Files are added and committed (`git add`, `git commit`).  
3. **Connect to GitHub**: The local repository is linked to GitHub with `git remote add origin`.  
4. **Push to GitHub**: Code is uploaded (`git push`) so others can access it.  
5. **Collaborate**: Team members clone the repository, create branches, and submit pull requests for review.  

This workflow makes Git powerful for version control and GitHub essential for teamwork.

## 5. Summary

- **Git = Tool**: A distributed version control system that runs locally.  
- **GitHub = Service**: A platform that uses Git repositories and adds collaboration, hosting, and workflow management.  

In short:  
> *Git is the engine that manages your project history, while GitHub is the garage where you share and collaborate on that engine with others.*
