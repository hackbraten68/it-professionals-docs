title: Issues and Project Boards
---

## Introduction

When collaborating on software projects, keeping track of tasks, bugs, and progress is essential.  
GitHub provides two key features to support this workflow: **Issues** and **Project Boards**.  
Together, they help teams stay organized, communicate clearly, and work efficiently.

## GitHub Issues

An **Issue** in GitHub acts like a digital to-do item or ticket.  
It can represent a bug, a new feature request, or a specific task to be completed.

### Key Uses of Issues

- **Track bugs**: Report and describe unexpected behavior in the software.  
- **Plan features**: Suggest new functionality or improvements.  
- **Assign tasks**: Delegate responsibilities to specific team members.  

### Features of Issues

- **Title and Description**: Provide context about the task or problem.  
- **Labels**: Categorize issues (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).  
- **Milestones**: Group issues into a larger goal or release plan.  
- **Assignees**: Assign issues to one or multiple contributors.  
- **Comments and Discussion**: Collaborate and communicate directly within the issue.  
- **References and Linking**: Link issues to pull requests or other issues for better traceability.  

> Issues are the foundation of collaboration in GitHub projects. They provide structure and accountability.

## GitHub Project Boards

**GitHub Projects** are visual boards, similar to Kanban systems, used to organize and track issues and pull requests.

### Key Benefits

- **Visual organization**: Use cards on a board to represent issues or tasks.  
- **Progress tracking**: Move cards across columns (e.g., *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Done*).  
- **Flexible workflows**: Adapt the board to Agile, Scrum, or personal workflows.  

### Typical Project Board Columns

- **To Do**: Upcoming tasks that need attention.  
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.  
- **Review**: Items awaiting review or testing.  
- **Done**: Completed work.  

### Features of Project Boards

- **Integration with Issues**: Issues and pull requests appear as cards on the board.  
- **Automation**: Cards can move automatically when issues are closed or PRs are merged.  
- **Custom Fields**: Add priority, status, or deadlines to tasks.  
- **Collaboration**: Teams can assign, comment, and update directly from the board.

## Combining Issues and Project Boards

When used together, **Issues** and **Project Boards** create a powerful project management system:

1. **Create an issue** to capture a bug, task, or feature idea.  
2. **Add the issue to a project board** as a card.  
3. **Track the issueâ€™s progress** by moving it through workflow columns.  
4. **Close the issue** when the task is complete, and the board updates automatically.  

This workflow ensures clarity, transparency, and accountability in software development teams.

## Use in Agile/Scrum Teams

- **Sprint planning**: Add issues to a sprint board for upcoming work.  
- **Daily stand-ups**: Review the board to discuss current progress.  
- **Retrospectives**: Analyze completed issues and milestones for improvements.  
- **Backlog grooming**: Prioritize issues in the backlog for future sprints.

## Summary

- **Issues**: Help track bugs, plan features, and assign tasks.  
- **Project Boards**: Provide a visual overview of progress, ideal for Agile/Scrum workflows.  
- **Together**: They create a structured, collaborative environment that keeps teams aligned and productive.
