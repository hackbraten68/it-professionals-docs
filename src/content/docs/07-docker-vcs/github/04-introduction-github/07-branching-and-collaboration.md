#### What is a branch?

A branch is an independent line of development. The default branch is usually `main` or `master`.

#### Basic Branch Commands

```bash
git branch                # list branches
git branch new-feature    # create a branch
git checkout new-feature  # switch to branch
git merge new-feature     # merge into main
```

Branches help you:

- Work on new features without affecting main code
- Test ideas safely
- Collaborate with others
