title: What is GitHub?
---

GitHub is a **web-based platform** primarily used for **version control** and **collaborative software development**. It builds upon Git, the distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds, and adds a wide range of collaboration, management, and automation features.  

GitHub has become one of the most widely used platforms in the software industry, supporting both open-source communities and private enterprise development teams.

## Why GitHub?

- **Centralized collaboration**: Developers from around the world can work together on the same project.
- **Integration with Git**: All the power of Git’s distributed workflow with an easy-to-use interface.
- **Community-driven**: Millions of developers contribute to open-source repositories hosted on GitHub.
- **Ecosystem**: A vast collection of integrations, APIs, and tools to streamline development.

## Key Features

### 1. Repository Hosting

- GitHub hosts code repositories in the cloud.
- Repositories can be **public** (open to everyone) or **private** (restricted to selected collaborators).
- Each repository can contain code, configuration files, and project resources.

### 2. Version Control with Git

- Built on Git, enabling developers to:
  - Track every change in the codebase.
  - Revert to previous versions when needed.
  - Branch and merge code safely for experimentation and feature development.

### 3. Issue Tracking

- Built-in system to report bugs, request features, and track project progress.
- Issues can be tagged, assigned, and linked to pull requests.
- Supports labels, milestones, and project boards for better project management.

### 4. Pull Requests (PRs)

- Core mechanism for collaboration:
  - Developers propose changes via pull requests.
  - Teammates review, discuss, and approve or request changes.
  - Pull requests provide a structured way to merge contributions into the main codebase.
- Enables **code review workflows** and ensures higher code quality.

### 5. GitHub Actions (CI/CD Automation)

- Automate workflows directly within GitHub.
- Common use cases:
  - Continuous Integration (running tests on each commit).
  - Continuous Deployment (deploying code automatically after approval).
  - Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., linting, security scans).

### 6. Wikis and Documentation

- Each repository can include a **Wiki** to provide structured documentation.
- Useful for:
  - Explaining project goals.
  - Sharing setup instructions.
  - Writing tutorials and developer guides.

## Additional Features

- **GitHub Pages**: Host static websites directly from a repository.
- **Security tools**: Dependabot alerts, secret scanning, and code scanning for vulnerabilities.
- **Project management**: Built-in project boards and kanban workflows for agile teams.
- **Community tools**: Discussions, templates for issues/PRs, and contributor guidelines.

## Summary

GitHub is more than just a place to store code—it is a **complete ecosystem for software development**.  
It combines the robustness of Git with collaboration, project management, automation, and community features.  

In practice, GitHub is the go-to platform for:

- **Open-source collaboration** (sharing projects with the world).
- **Team development** (private repositories and enterprise workflows).
- **Learning and experimenting** (trying out new technologies in shared environments).

By using GitHub, developers not only manage their code but also build, document, and share knowledge effectively.
