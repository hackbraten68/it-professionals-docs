## Key Takeaways

### 1. GitHub as a Platform

- Provides cloud hosting for your Git repositories.  
- Enables collaboration with teams of any size.  
- Offers tools for code review, automation, and project management.  

### 2. Git Basics

To be effective with GitHub, you must understand Git’s core functionality:

- **Commits** record snapshots of your work.  
- **Branches** allow you to work on features independently.  
- **Merging** integrates changes back into the main codebase.  
- **History tracking** ensures transparency about what changed, when, and why.  

### 3. Creating Repositories

- Start by creating a **repository** (local or on GitHub).  
- Repositories are the central place to store your project code.  
- They also contain important files like README, license, and `.gitignore`.

### 4. Branches and Pull Requests

- **Branches** let you experiment or build features without affecting the main branch.  
- **Pull Requests (PRs)** provide a structured workflow for merging changes, including:
  - Code discussion  
  - Review process  
  - Conflict resolution  
  - Approval before merging  

### 5. Collaboration with Issues and Project Boards

- **Issues**: Track bugs, feature requests, or tasks in a structured way.  
- **Project Boards**: Visualize tasks using Kanban-style boards to monitor progress.  
- Together, they bring agile workflows into your GitHub repositories.

   - A tool for educators and students.  
   - Enables assignment distribution, submissions, and automated feedback.  

2. **GitHub Pages**  
   - Free hosting service directly from your repositories.  
   - Ideal for personal websites, documentation, or project pages.  
   - Supports static site generators like Jekyll.  

3. **GitHub Actions**  
   - Automate workflows such as testing, building, and deploying code.  
   - Supports continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD).  
   - Highly customizable through YAML-based configuration files.
