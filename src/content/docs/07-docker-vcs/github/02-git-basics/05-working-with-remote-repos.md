# Working with Remote Repositories

Remote repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, self‑hosted Git servers) enable collaboration, backup, CI/CD, and code review. This guide explains how to connect a local repository to remotes, synchronize changes, manage branches, and follow good practices—clearly and comprehensively.

---

## 1) Remote Basics

* A **remote** is a named reference to a repository hosted elsewhere.
* The default remote name is typically `origin`.
* You can have multiple remotes (e.g., `origin` for your fork, `upstream` for the original project).
* Local branches can **track** remote branches to sync in both directions.

Simple mental model:

```bash
Local repo (your machine)  <--sync-->  Remote repo (server/host)
   | working tree
   | index (staging)
   | commits (history)
```

---

## 2) Adding & Inspecting Remotes

### Add a Remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

* `origin` is a conventional name; you can choose another.
* Use HTTPS or SSH (see next section).

### Verify/Inspect Remotes

```bash
git remote -v
# Lists remotes with fetch/push URLs

git remote show origin
# Detailed info: tracked branches, push/pull status, etc.
```

### Change or Remove Remote

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/new-repo.git
git remote rename origin primary
git remote remove origin
```

---

## 3) Authenticating: HTTPS vs SSH

### HTTPS

* URL form: `https://github.com/user/repo.git`
* Usually paired with a **credential helper** (e.g., Git Credential Manager) or **Personal Access Token (PAT)**.
* Easiest to start with; may require token input on push.

### SSH

* URL form: `git@github.com:user/repo.git`
* Uses SSH keys (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519` preferred).
* One‑time setup; then seamless pushes/pulls.

Generate an SSH key and add to host:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
# Add public key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) to Git host account
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Set a credential helper (if using HTTPS):

```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager
# or: osxkeychain / libsecret depending on OS
```

---

## 4) Cloning Repositories

Create a local copy from a remote:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo
```

Options:

```bash
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/user/repo.git
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repo.git        # shallow clone
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/user/repo.git # partial clone
```

* **Shallow** and **partial** clones reduce download size.
* The cloned repo automatically has `origin` set and the default branch checked out.

---

## 5) Pushing Changes

### First Push (set upstream)

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

* `-u` sets the **upstream** so future `git push`/`git pull` know where to sync.
* If your local branch doesn’t exist on the remote, this creates it.

### Subsequent Pushes

```bash
git push
```

### Pushing a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/api
git push -u origin feature/api
```

### Push Only Tags or Specific Refs

```bash
git push origin v1.2.0
git push origin main:production   # push local main to remote production
```

---

## 6) Pulling, Fetching, and Rebasing

**Key distinction:**

* `git fetch` downloads remote updates **without** changing your working branch.
* `git pull` is shorthand for `git fetch` + **integrate** (merge or rebase).

### Pull (default: merge)

```bash
git pull
```

### Pull with Rebase (cleaner history)

```bash
git pull --rebase
# or make it the default for your repo:
git config pull.rebase true
```

### Fetch and Review Before Integrating

```bash
git fetch origin
git log --oneline --graph --decorate ..origin/main
# Then choose: merge or rebase
git merge origin/main
# or
git rebase origin/main
```

---

## 7) Tracking (Upstream) Branches

A **tracking** branch links a local branch to a remote branch for easy sync.

Set tracking on first push:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Set or change tracking later:

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
git branch -vv   # show tracking info
```

Unset tracking:

```bash
git branch --unset-upstream
```

---

## 8) Working with Multiple Remotes (forks, mirrors)

Common pattern when contributing to open source:

```bash
# You cloned your fork (origin)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# Sync your local main with upstream’s main
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main   # or merge

# Push the updated main back to your fork
git push origin main
```

Other scenarios:

* **Read‑only mirror**: Add a remote you only fetch from.
* **Write mirror**: Push to multiple remotes (rare; be careful).

---

## 9) Tags and Releases

Tags mark specific commits (e.g., versions).

```bash
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0         # push a single tag
git push origin --tags          # push all local tags
```

Annotated tags (preferred for releases):

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release 1.2.0"
```

Fetch remote tags:

```bash
git fetch --tags
```

---

## 10) Pruning and Cleaning Up

Remove local references to branches deleted on the remote:

```bash
git fetch --prune
# or make it default:
git config fetch.prune true
```

Delete remote branches you no longer need:

```bash
git push origin --delete feature/old
```

Delete local branches safely:

```bash
git branch -d feature/old    # refuses if not merged
git branch -D feature/old    # force delete
```

---

## 11) Resolving Conflicts

Conflicts occur when both sides changed the same lines.

Typical flow:

```bash
git pull --rebase
# Git stops at conflicts
# Edit files to resolve conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>
git add path/to/conflicted-file
git rebase --continue
```

If you used `pull` (merge):

```bash
git pull
# resolve conflicts, then
git add .
git commit
```

Abort if needed:

```bash
git rebase --abort
git merge --abort
```

Pro tip: stash local work before pulling if it’s uncommitted:

```bash
git stash push -m "wip before pull"
git pull --rebase
git stash pop
```

---

## 12) Protected Branches & Safe Force Push

Many teams **protect** branches like `main` (no force pushes, required reviews/CI).

If you must rewrite history on a shared branch, use **force-with-lease**:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

* Safer than `--force`; it refuses to overwrite others’ new work.

Avoid rewriting history on public/shared branches unless absolutely necessary.

---

## 13) Large Files (Git LFS)

Git Large File Storage (LFS) stores large binaries outside normal Git objects.

Basic setup:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.psd"
git add .gitattributes
git add path/to/large.psd
git commit -m "Track large files with LFS"
git push
```

* Ensure your remote supports LFS and quotas.

---

## 14) CI/CD and Remotes

* Pushing to remotes often triggers CI pipelines (tests, lint, build).
* Use **branches** and **pull/merge requests** to gate changes.
* Avoid committing secrets; use the host’s **secrets management** for tokens/keys.
* Conventional branches and messages help automation (e.g., `feat/`, `fix/`, semantic commits).

---

## 15) Troubleshooting

**“Authentication failed”**

* Check token validity (HTTPS) or SSH key config.
* Verify remote URL matches your auth method.

**“Repository not found” / 404**

* You may lack permissions, or the URL/owner is wrong.

**“refspec … does not match any”**

* The branch/tag doesn’t exist locally—create it or check spelling.

**Non‑fast‑forward push rejected**

* The remote has new commits. First `git pull --rebase` (or merge), then push.

**“You have unstaged changes” when pulling**

* Commit or stash first: `git add -A && git commit -m "wip"` or `git stash`.

**Branches out of sync after force push**

* `git fetch --all --prune` and reset carefully if needed:

  ```bash
  git checkout feature/x
  git reset --hard origin/feature/x
  ```

---

## 16) Best Practices Checklist

* Use **SSH** for long‑term convenience or **HTTPS + credential manager**.
* Always set upstream on first push: `git push -u origin <branch>`.
* Prefer `git pull --rebase` to keep history linear (team policy permitting).
* Fetch before integrating: `git fetch --prune`.
* Keep feature branches short‑lived; delete them after merging.
* Protect `main`/`release` branches; require PR reviews and passing CI.
* Use **force-with-lease** instead of `--force` when absolutely required.
* Track large binaries with **Git LFS** (or store them outside Git).
* Never commit secrets; use `.gitignore` and secret managers.
* Document your workflow in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
