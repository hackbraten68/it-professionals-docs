title: Summary

- Rebase keeps your commit history clean but rewrites history – use with caution.
- Stashing is great for temporarily saving changes without committing them.
- Tags are ideal for marking releases or other important points in the project history.

Tip: Rebase and force push (`git push --force`) can break others’ work if shared history is modified. Communicate with your team!
