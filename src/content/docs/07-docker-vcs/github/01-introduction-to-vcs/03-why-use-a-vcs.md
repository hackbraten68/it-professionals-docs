title: Why Use a Version Control System?
---
Using a VCS offers several important benefits:

### 1. History Tracking

You can view a complete history of all changes made, who made them, and why.

### 2. Collaboration

Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.

### 3. Branching and Merging

You can create branches to experiment or add features, and later merge them back into the main codebase.

### 4. Backup and Recovery

You can restore older versions or recover accidentally deleted code.
