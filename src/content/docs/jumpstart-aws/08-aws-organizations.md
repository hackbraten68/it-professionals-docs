Welcome to Introduction to AWS Organizations

![What you will learn](../../../assets/jumpstart/aws-organizations/targets.png)

In this lesson, you will learn how the AWS Organizations service provides billing and support functions. You will also review the main features and benefits of AWS Organizations.

## AWS Organizations

![AWS Organizations](../../../assets/jumpstart/aws-organizations/aws_organizations_diagram.png)

**AWS Organizations** is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an **organization** that you create and centrally manage.

AWS Organizations includes:

- **Consolidated billing**
- **Account management capabilities**

These features help you better meet the **budgetary**, **security**, and **compliance** needs of your business.

---

The diagram shows a basic **organization**, or **root**.  
This example organization consists of **seven accounts** that are organized into **six organizational units (OUs)**.

- An **OU** is a container for accounts within a root.
- An OU can also contain **other OUs**, which enables you to create a **hierarchy** that resembles an **upside-down tree**:
  - The **root** is at the top.
  - The **branches** are OUs.
  - The **leaves** are the individual accounts.

When you attach a **policy** to one of the nodes in the hierarchy, it flows down and affects **all the branches and leaves**.

Key points:

- This organization has several policies attached to OUs or directly to accounts.
- An OU can have **only one parent**.
- Each account can be a member of **exactly one OU**.
- An **account** is a standard AWS account that contains your AWS resources.
- You can attach a policy to an individual account to apply controls **only to that account**.

## Key features and benefits

![Key features and benefits](../../../assets/jumpstart/aws-organizations/features_benefits.png)

**The main benefits of AWS Organizations are:**

- **Centrally managed access policies** across multiple AWS accounts  
- **Controlled access** to AWS services  
- **Automated AWS account creation and management**  
- **Consolidated billing** across multiple AWS accounts

## Security with AWS Organizations

![Security with AWS Organizations](../../../assets/jumpstart/aws-organizations/security_aws_organizations.png)

**AWS Organizations** does **not** replace associating **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies** with users, groups, and roles within an AWS account.

- **IAM policies** enable you to allow or deny access to:
  - AWS services (e.g., **Amazon S3**)
  - Individual AWS resources (e.g., a specific **S3 bucket**)
  - Individual API operations (e.g., `s3:CreateBucket`)

- An **IAM policy** can be applied only to:
  - IAM **users**
  - IAM **groups**
  - IAM **roles**

> ðŸ”’ **Note:** IAM policies **cannot** restrict the **AWS account root user**.

---

In contrast, with **AWS Organizations**, you use **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to allow or deny access to specific AWS services for:

- Individual AWS accounts
- Groups of accounts in an **Organizational Unit (OU)**

The specified actions from an attached **SCP** affect **all IAM users, groups, and roles** for an account â€” **including the root user**.

## Organizations setup

![Organizations setup](../../../assets/jumpstart/aws-organizations/organizations_setup.png)

**To create and set up an organization, follow these steps:**

1. **Create your organization**  
   Use your current AWS account as the **management account**.  
   > This process assumes that you have **administrator permissions** in your current account.  
   After creating the organization, you can:
   - Create **new accounts**, or
   - **Invite existing accounts** to join using the management account.

2. **Create Organizational Units (OUs)**  
   In your new organization, create OUs and **move the member accounts** into those OUs.

3. **Create Service Control Policies (SCPs)**  
   SCPs enable you to apply **restrictions** to what actions can be delegated to **users and roles** in the member accounts.  
   > An SCP is a type of **organization control policy**.

4. **Test your organizationâ€™s policies**  
   - Sign in as a user for each **role in your OUs** to see how SCPs impact account access.
   - Alternatively, use the **IAM policy simulator** to test and troubleshoot:
     - IAM policies
     - Resource-based policies  
     > These can be attached to IAM users, groups, or roles in your AWS account.  
     > To learn more, refer to: *[Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html)*.

### Naming rules

![AWS Organizations](../../../assets/jumpstart/aws-organizations/aws_organizations.png)

When you create names in **AWS Organizations**â€”including names of **accounts**, **organizational units (OUs)**, **roots**, and **policies**â€”you must follow certain rules.

- Names must be composed of **Unicode characters**
- Names can be up to **250 characters** in length

There are a number of other **maximum and minimum values** for entities in AWS Organizations.  
Some of the main values are shown in the table (refer to the official documentation for the complete list).

## Accessing AWS Organizations

![Accessing AWS Organizations](../../../assets/jumpstart/aws-organizations/accessing_aws_organizations.png)

**AWS Organizations** is available to all AWS customers **at no additional charge**.  
It can be managed through different interfaces:

- **AWS Management Console**  
  A browser-based interface to manage your organization and AWS resources.  
  > You can perform any task in your organization using the console.

- **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)**  
  Enables you to issue commands to perform AWS Organizations and other AWS tasks.  
  > The CLI can be faster and more convenient than using the console.

- **AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)**  
  Help you manage tasks like:
  - Cryptographically signing requests
  - Managing errors
  - Retrying requests automatically

  AWS SDKs consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms, such as:
  - Java
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - .NET
  - iOS
  - Android

- **AWS Organizations HTTPS Query API**  
  Provides programmatic access to AWS Organizations via **direct HTTPS requests**.  
  > When using this API, you must **digitally sign requests** using your credentials.
