Welcome to Cost Management and Best Practices.

![What you will learn](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/targets.png)

In this module, you will learn **strategies**, **tools**, and **best practices** for reducing cost in the AWS Cloud.

**Specifically, you will learn how to:**

- Describe some of the **cost benefits** of the cloud  
- Identify key **AWS cost management tools and services**  
- Apply **best practices for cost optimization**

## Cost benefits of the cloud and opportunities for cost reduction

![Cost benefits of the cloud and opportunities for cost reduction](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/cost_benefits.png)

One of the fundamental benefits of **cloud computing** is that you **pay only for what you need, when you need it**.  
Because of this principle, you can find ways to **use cloud resources efficiently** and **reduce cost**.

You can apply various strategies to achieve this goal, including:

- Creating **scripts or templates** that can easily start up and shut down entire environments
- **Turning off unused resources**, for example:
  - **Development** or **test environments** can be shut down at project termination
  - Specific services can be shut down **after business hours** and **during holidays**
  - **Disaster recovery (DR)** environments can remain **inactive** until needed
  - **Temporary instances** (tagged accordingly) can be turned off after a **specified time period**

## AWS cost management tools and services

![AWS cost management tools and services](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/cost_management_tools.png)

You can also use **AWS cost management tools and services** to help you **access**, **organize**, **understand**, **control**, and **optimize** your AWS costs and usage.

For example:

- You can access the overall status of your AWS costs and usage in the **AWS Billing Dashboard**.  
  - The **Bills** page shows the most up-to-date information about your monthly bill and a detailed breakdown of the AWS services you use.  
  - The **Cost and Usage Reports** page allows you to generate reports with the **most granular data**, helping you analyze and understand specific product usage and associated costs.

- You can dive deeper into your data with **AWS Cost Explorer** to:  
  - Identify **trends**  
  - Pinpoint **cost drivers**  
  - Detect **anomalies**  
  - It provides an intuitive interface to create **custom reports** (charts and tables) for both high-level and detailed analysis.

- You can set **custom cost targets and usage budgets** with **AWS Budgets**.  
  - This service alerts you when your defined thresholds are exceeded.

- You can monitor your **usage charges** using **Amazon CloudWatch**.  
  - Create **alarms** to notify you when usage charges exceed a specified threshold.

---

üìò You will learn more about these tools and services in the **next slides**.

## AWS billing dashboard

![AWS billing dashboard](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/aws_billing_dashboard_.png)

The **AWS Billing Dashboard** enables you to view the **status of your month-to-date AWS expenditure**.  
You can also use it to:

- Identify the **services** that account for the **majority of your overall expenditure**
- Get a **high-level understanding** of how your **costs are trending**

---

### Key Graphs in the Billing Dashboard:

- **Spend Summary**  
  - Shows how much you spent **last month**
  - Displays your **month-to-date usage cost**
  - Provides a **forecast** of your likely total spending for the current month

- **Month-to-Date Spend by Service**  
  - Shows the **top services** you use the most

- Monitor individual **daily** and **monthly** spend for each linked account

## AWS Budgets

![AWS Budgets](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/aws_budgets.png)

**AWS Budgets** enables you to set **custom budgets** that alert you when **costs or usage** exceed  
(or are forecasted to exceed) your defined **budgeted amount**.

---

### Key Features of AWS Budgets:

- Uses **Cost Explorer** visualization to:
  - Show the **status of your budgets**
  - Provide **forecasts** of estimated costs

- Allows you to:
  - Create **notifications** when:
    - Actual costs exceed your budget
    - Estimated costs are forecasted to exceed your budget

- **Budget tracking options:**
  - Monthly
  - Quarterly
  - Yearly
  - You can also **customize the start and end dates**

- **Budget alerts** can be sent via:
  - **Email**
  - **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)** topic

---

### Example Scenario

An **alert notification** was generated by AWS Budgets because **actual costs exceeded 80%** of the defined budget.  
As a result, **one person was notified** based on the configured alert settings.

## AWS Cost and Usage Reports 

![AWS Cost and Usage Reports ](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/cost_usage_reports.png)

The **AWS Cost and Usage Reports** page is a central location for accessing **comprehensive information** about your AWS **costs and usage**.

---

### Key Features:

## Amazon CloudWatch billing alarms

![Amazon CloudWatch billing alarms](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/cloudwatch_billing_alarm.png)

You can monitor your **estimated AWS charges** by using **Amazon CloudWatch** to generate an **alert**  
when your charges exceed a specified **threshold**.

---

### How it works:

- When **billing monitoring** is enabled:
  - **Estimated charges** are calculated and sent **several times daily** to CloudWatch as **metric data**
  - This data is stored in the **US East (N. Virginia)** Region and represents **worldwide charges**
  - It includes:
    - Estimated charges **per AWS service**
    - The **overall total** estimated charges

- You can create a **CloudWatch alarm** that triggers when your **actual billing** exceeds a defined threshold  
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è The alarm does **not** use projected values ‚Äî only **actual billing data**

---

### Alarm Behavior:

- If your charges have **already exceeded** the threshold at the time of creation,  
  the alarm immediately enters the **ALARM** state

- **Notifications** are sent via **Amazon SNS** to a configured **email address**

## Designing for cost reduction

![Designing for cost reduction](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/design_cost_reduction.png)

With the aid of **cost management tools**, you can devise a **cost-reduction strategy** for your AWS services.

A good strategy includes the following **cost-optimization principles**:

- **Set custom cost and usage budgets**  
  ‚Üí Helps you follow the cloud computing principle: *"Pay only for what you need, when you need it"*

- **Right-size instances**  
  - Use **T2 or T3 instances** for workloads that occasionally need to burst to full performance  
    ‚Üí These instance types provide a **baseline CPU performance** with the ability to **burst when needed**  
    ‚Üí **T3 instances** use the latest **Intel Xeon Scalable processors** and offer up to **30% better price/performance** than T2

  - Consider purchasing **Reserved Instances** for groups of **long-running instances**

  - Use **Spot Instances** for **batch-processing jobs** and to optimize pricing  
    ‚Üí Analyze **Spot Instance history reports** to fine-tune bid strategies

- **Use AWS Lambda**  
  ‚Üí The **serverless model** lets you run code **without managing servers**  
  ‚Üí You **pay only for compute time used** and incur **no charges** when your code is idle

- **Use managed services**  
  ‚Üí Services like **Amazon S3** and **Amazon RDS** reduce operational overhead and allow you to operate at **cloud scale**  
  ‚Üí They also offer a **lower cost per transaction or service**

- **Use AWS Trusted Advisor**  
  ‚Üí Get **specific, actionable recommendations** to help **reduce cost**

## Finding and eliminating waste

![Finding and eliminating waste](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/find_eliminate_waste.png)

Another effective **cost-reduction technique** is to **find and eliminate waste**.

For example, the ease of provisioning resources can sometimes lead to situations where **unneeded resources remain running**.

---

### Tools and Techniques to Identify Waste:

- Use **Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms** to:
  - Detect **long-running idle instances**
  - **Shut them down** automatically or with review

- A **CloudWatch utilization graph** (as shown in the example) can help identify:
  - Instances that are **idle**
  - Instances that are **rarely used**

- Use **AWS Cost Explorer** to:
  - Find costs associated with **entire projects or initiatives**
  - Identify the **most costly projects**
  - **Prioritize** which projects to examine first for **cost-reduction opportunities**

## Using a stopinator script

![Using a stopinator script](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/stopinator_script.png)

**Writing and using a Stopinator script** is a technique for **automating the shutdown of instances**.

A **Stopinator** is a generic term for any **script or application** written to interact with the **AWS Cloud**,  
designed to **identify and stop unused instances**.

---

### Key Characteristics:

- Typically runs **in the evenings and on weekends**
- Helps to **automatically stop** instances that are not in use
- Can lead to **significant cost savings** for an organization
- **Frees up budget** for other cloud projects

---

### Dual Functionality:

A Stopinator is often also designed to **start resources when needed**,  
for example at the **beginning of the workday** ‚Äî making it a **useful automation utility**.

## Serverless stopinator

![Serverless stopinator](../../../assets/jumpstart/cost-management/serverless_stopinator.png)

You do **not** need to create or use an **Amazon EC2 instance** to run a Stopinator.

A **simple and efficient design** is to use a **serverless solution** that combines:

- An **AWS Lambda function**  
- An **Amazon CloudWatch Events** (now known as EventBridge) **event**

---

### How it works:

- The **logic** to **stop and start instances** is implemented in a **Lambda function**
- The function is triggered by a **CloudWatch Events rule** based on a **defined schedule**

This approach is lightweight, cost-efficient, and easy to manage.

---
