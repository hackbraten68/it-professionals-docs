## Working with Files

### The `hash` command

![The hash command](../../../assets/day-8/hash_command.png)

The `hash` command can be used to view recently run programs, their location in the file system, and the number of times they were run. Specifically, the `hash` command displays or modifies the remembered location of the program associated with a given command and how many times the command was run. It stores this information in a hash table and provides options to display, reset, or delete the table’s content. A program’s location information consists of its full path name in the file system.

**Syntax:**

`hash [-lr] [-p pathName] [-dt] [commandName ...]`

Some command options are as follows:

- `-d`: Deletes the location for `commandName` from the hash table
- `-l`: Displays output in a format that can be used as input to another command
- `-p`: Sets `pathName` as the full path location for `commandName`
- `-r`: Empties the hash table
- `-t`: Displays the location of `commandName`

### The `cksum` command

![The cksum command](../../../assets/day-8/cksum_command.png)

The `cksum` command generates a checksum value for a file or stream of data that the user can use to see whether the file was corrupted during transfer. Specifically, it computes and displays a *cyclic redundancy check (CRC)* value for the file and shows its size in bytes.

The CRC value is derived from the contents of the file and is used to validate the file's integrity. If a file's checksum value is the same before and after a transfer, the file was not corrupted.

### The `find` command

![The find command](../../../assets/day-8/find_command.png)

The `find` command searches a directory and any of its subdirectories for files that match specific criteria. Search criteria can include:

- File name
- File type
- File size
- File owner
- File modification date

You can search by logical expressions. When searching by name, wildcard characters can be used to match based on a character pattern. In addition, you can specify an action to take on matching files, such as delete or run a specified command on them.

The `find` command can also be used with pipe (`|`) to input the findings into another program.

In the example that is shown, the `find` command returns all files with a name of `fileA.txt` in the `/home/student01` directory and its subdirectories.

#### `find` options

![find options](../../../assets/day-8/find_options.png)

You can use the options for the `find` command to specify the type of search to perform: for example, by name, owner, or file type. You can also specify actions to take on the returned file matches.

#### Actions that are used with the `find` command

![Actions that are used with the find command](../../../assets/day-8/find_actions.png)

The `find` command can perform actions on the files that match the search criteria. Some examples are as follows:

- `-fprint fileName`: Writes the output of the command to the specified file name
- `-exec commandName`: Runs the specified command on the returned file or files
- `-delete`: Deletes the returned file or files

#### Examples of the `find` command

![Examples of the find command](../../../assets/day-8/find_example.png)

This slide shows examples of the `find` command:

- The first example shows how to search for a file that is named `fileA.txt` and starts in the current directory. The search should ignore the case of the letters in the file name pattern.

- The second example shows how to search for files that `student01` owns, which start in the `/home/student01` directory.

- The third example shows how to search for files with a file name extension of `.jpg` that start in the `/home/student01` directory.

- The fourth example shows how to search for files with a file name extension of `.conf` that start in the `/etc` directory. The search should be case insensitive and return only those matching files that were modified exactly 168 (7 x 24) hours ago.

#### Demonstration: the `find` command

![Demo: find command](../../../assets/day-8/find_demo.png)

In this demonstration, the instructor will show various forms of the `find` command. Some examples are as follows:

- Find files that have a specific name extension: `find <startingDirectoryName> -name <*.extension>`
- Find files that have a specific name extension up to a subdirectory depth of 1: `find <startingDirectoryName> -maxdepth 1 -name <*.extension>`

### The `grep` command

![The grep command](../../../assets/day-8/grep_command.png)

The `grep` command searches a file or a directory for a particular text pattern or string and displays each occurrence. You can control the search behavior and output through various options.

#### Example: The `grep` command

![Example the grep command](../../../assets/day-8/grep_example.png)

In this example, the `grep` command matches the pattern text fail to the file contents.

#### `find` and `grep` comparison

![find and grep comparison](../../../assets/day-8/grep_comparison.png)

The `find` and `grep` commands have one main difference:

- The `find` command is used to **locate files** that match specified criteria.
- The `grep` command is used to **find a string in a file**.

### The `diff` command

![The diff command](../../../assets/day-8/diff_command.png)

The `diff` command compares two files line by line and displays the differences between the two files.

### Links and inode

![Links and inode](../../../assets/day-8/links.png)

You can use a link to refer to a given file by using different names. By creating multiple links for the same file, you can access it from more than one location in the file system.

Linux has two types of links:

1. **Hard link**: Every file has an object that is called inode, which stores the file's disk block locations and attributes. An inode is identified with a unique number. A hard link is a pointer to a file's inode.

2. **Symbolic link**: Also known as a soft link or symlink, a symbolic link points to the original file name or a hard link.

In the example, a music file was originally created with a complete path name of `/home/library/music/johnDoe-song1.mp4` and an inode that was identified as `24317`. 

A hard link was then created to allow access to the file through a directory structure that categorized the song by its artist's name: `/artist/johnDoe/song1.mp4`. 

A soft link was also created to identify it as the favorite song in a playlist directory: `/myPlaylist/favoriteSong.mp4`.

### Hard link

![Hard link](../../../assets/day-8/hard_link.png)

Some important things to keep in mind with hard links include the following:

- No visual difference exists between a hard link and a file in a directory listing. When you use the `ls` command to list a directory, no special indicators show that an entry is a hard link.

- If the original file is deleted, its contents still exist until the hard link is deleted.

The screen capture shows how to create a hard link that is named `fileA` for the file that is named `file1`.

### Symbolic Link

![Symbolic Link](../../../assets/day-8/symbolic_link.png)

Some important things to keep in mind with symbolic links include the following:

- Technically, you can also make a symbolic link point to a hard link. A hard link is like the original file name because it points to the file's inode.

- A visual difference exists between a symbolic link and a file in a directory listing. When you use the `ls` command to list a directory, a symbolic link points to its original file name.

- If the original file is deleted, the symbolic link is broken and has no value. If you create a new file with the original name, the symbolic link will work as expected again.

The screen capture shows how to create a symbolic link that is named `sym-fileA` for the file that is named `fileA`.

#### Demonstration: Links

![Demo Links](../../../assets/day-8/links_demo.png)

In this demonstration, the instructor will show you how to create a soft link by using the link command: `ln -s [originalFileName] [linkName]`
