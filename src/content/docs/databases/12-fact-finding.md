<details>
<summary>What are a list and tuple in Python, and what are some examples?</summary>

- **List**: A list in Python is a mutable, ordered sequence of elements. You can modify, add, or remove elements after the list is created.
  - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"]`

- **Tuple**: A tuple in Python is an immutable, ordered sequence of elements. Once a tuple is created, it cannot be modified.
  - Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")`

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a namespace in Python?</summary>

A **namespace** in Python is a container that holds a set of identifiers (variable and function names) and maps them to corresponding objects. Namespaces ensure that names are unique and can be used without conflicts in different parts of a program.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable?</summary>

- **Local Variable**: A local variable is a variable that is defined within a function and is only accessible within that function.
  
- **Global Variable**: A global variable is a variable that is defined outside of any function and can be accessed from any part of the program.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is an IDE, and what are some common IDEs that could be used with Python?</summary>

An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development. It typically includes a code editor, debugger, and build tools.

- **Common Python IDEs**: 
  - PyCharm
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Spyder

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are modules in Python, and what are some examples?</summary>

**Modules** in Python are files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. They can be imported and used in other Python programs.

- **Examples**:
  - `math`: Provides mathematical functions like `sqrt()` and `pow()`.
  - `os`: Allows interaction with the operating system, like reading or writing to the file system.
  - `datetime`: Provides classes for manipulating dates and times.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between an array and a list?</summary>

- **Array**: An array is a collection of elements that are of the same data type. In Python, arrays are available via the `array` module.
  
- **List**: A list can contain elements of different data types. It is more versatile than an array but typically slower for certain operations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are operators, and what are some examples?</summary>

**Operators** are symbols in Python that perform operations on variables and values.

- **Examples**:
  - **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (e.g., `5 + 3`)
  - **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<` (e.g., `5 > 3`)
  - **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not` (e.g., `True and False`)

</details>

### Databases fact-finding exercise

![Databases fact-finding exercise](../../../assets/databases/fact_finding/database_fact_finding.png)

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between a relational and a non-relational database?</summary>

- **Relational Database**: Stores data in structured tables with predefined schemas, where relationships between data are defined through foreign keys. Commonly used for structured data with clear relationships, such as SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

- **Non-Relational Database**: Also known as NoSQL databases, they store data in flexible formats like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. They are used for unstructured or semi-structured data without strict schemas, such as MongoDB or DynamoDB.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are indexes?</summary>

**Indexes** are special database structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They are created using one or more columns of a table and allow for faster querying, at the cost of additional storage and slower write operations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are primary keys and secondary keys?</summary>

- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same primary key value, and it cannot be null.
  
- **Secondary Key** (or Foreign Key): A column or set of columns that establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables. Secondary keys reference the primary key in another table.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are inner joins and outer joins?</summary>

- **Inner Join**: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It returns only the records that have matching values in both tables.
  
- **Outer Join**: Combines rows from two or more tables and returns all the records from one table and the matched records from the other table. If there is no match, it returns null for non-matching rows. Outer joins can be further classified into:
  - **Left Outer Join**: Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table.
  - **Right Outer Join**: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table.
  - **Full Outer Join**: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between DROP TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE?</summary>

- **DROP TABLE**: Completely removes a table and all its data, indexes, triggers, and constraints from the database. This operation is irreversible.

- **TRUNCATE TABLE**: Removes all rows from a table, but the table structure, columns, indexes, and constraints remain intact. It is faster than DELETE but cannot be rolled back.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the different data types in SQL?</summary>

**SQL Data Types**: Define the type of data that can be stored in a column. Some common data types include:

- **Numeric**: `INT`, `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`
- **Character**: `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`
- **Date and Time**: `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`
- **Boolean**: `BOOLEAN`
- **Binary**: `BLOB`

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the WHERE and HAVING clauses used for?</summary>

- **WHERE Clause**: Filters records before any groupings are made. It is used to specify conditions that must be true for rows to be included in the result set.

- **HAVING Clause**: Filters records after the GROUP BY clause has been applied. It is used to specify conditions on aggregate functions for groups.

Amazon EC2 offers several pricing models to fit different use cases:

1. **On-Demand Instances**:
   - Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments.
   - Ideal for short-term, unpredictable workloads or for applications being developed or tested.

2. **Reserved Instances (RIs)**:
   - Offer significant discounts (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing in exchange for committing to a one- or three-year term.
   - Suitable for stable, predictable workloads.

3. **Spot Instances**:
   - Allow you to bid on spare Amazon EC2 capacity at discounted prices, up to 90% off On-Demand rates.
   - Best for flexible, fault-tolerant workloads, as instances can be terminated by AWS when the spot price exceeds your bid.

4. **Savings Plans**:
   - A flexible pricing model that offers lower prices on EC2 usage in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) over a one- or three-year term.
   - Provides savings similar to Reserved Instances but with more flexibility.

5. **Dedicated Hosts**:
   - Physical servers fully dedicated to your use, providing complete control over instance placement.
   - Useful for meeting compliance requirements and reducing costs by using existing software licenses.
